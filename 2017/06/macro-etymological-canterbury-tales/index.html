</h1><article><p>Posted 2017-06-06</p><p>Chaucer’s <em>Canterbury Tales</em> exhibits one of the richest
vocabularies of Middle English literature, a vocabulary that reveals
influences from a number of native and foreign languages: Old English,
French, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, among others. While some of this
foreign influence may be attributed simply to the history of the English
language—the Roman Empire, the Norman conquest of 1066, and several
waves of Scandinavian immigrants are each responsible for the addition
of new linguistic layers—some of it is attributable to Chaucer’s own
knowledge of languages: as a well-traveled member of a quasi-courtier
class, he had a good knowledge of European languages. Regardless of
whether the poet’s word choices were consciously foreign at the time of
writing in the fourteenth century, however, there are etymological
resonances in each word that evoke levels of formality, social class,
and genre. A commonly-discussed group of words that illustrates this
phenomenon is the triplet <em>kingly, royal</em>, and <em>regal</em>.
The first is of Old English origin; the second, of French, and the
third, of Latin. Each possesses a set of associations with their
etymological registers that make these words imperfect synonyms. The
following experiment will attempt to computationally detect these
registers, by quantifying the etymologies of all the words of the
<em>Canterbury Tales</em>.</p>
<h2 id="pre-digital-macro-etymology">Pre-Digital Macro-Etymology</h2>
<p>Macro-Etymological textual analysis is nothing new. Even before what
is now known as the digital humanities, and before its precursor,
humanities computing, philologists have painstakingly quantified
Chaucer’s words and their etymological origins. One of the most recent
of these studies is Joseph Mersand’s 1939 <em>Chaucer’s Romance
Vocabulary</em>. Using, presumably, nothing more technically complicated
than sweat and graph paper, he concludes that Chaucer’s working
vocabulary is 8,430 words, of which 51.8% are of “Romance sources,” and
49% of Germanic sources (1939, 43). Many, if not most, critics writing
about Chaucer’s vocabulary after Mersand have opinions about this
method. Christopher Cannon, for instance, argues that while Mersand is
not factually incorrect, he would be incorrect to draw conclusions about
Chaucer’s personal “borrowings” from this data alone (2003, 238). Simon
Horobin contends that Mersand’s analysis is invalid, in its reliance on
the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> instead of the <em>Middle English
Dictionary</em> (2007, 79), and J.D. Burnley dismisses Mersand’s
findings as “of little use in assessing Chaucerian style, and indeed
simply ignores the crucial factor of the contemporary perception of the
status of the words” (1983, 135). These dismissals, although annoyingly
grouchy in tone, all make fair points, which I hope to address in my
algorithmic design below.</p>
<p>Mersand is hardly an innovator in Chaucerian macro-etymological
analysis, however, as he himself readily admits. In fact, a full chapter
of his book is devoted to early quantitative analyses of Chaucer’s
vocabulary and its etymologies. Among these are a study by George Marsh
in 1859, Alexander Ellis in 1869, and John Wisse in 1878. Mersand even
expresses surprise that no “no definite numerical investigation was made
before 1850,” despite allusions to Chaucer’s etymologies as early as
1400 (1939, 21). Each of these previous analyses, however, have
methodological problems that Marsand hopes to correct, as I hope to use
computational methods to correct and expand upon his.</p>
<h1 id="methods">Methods</h1>
<h2 id="the-text">The Text</h2>
<p>Since this analysis relies on tools of natural language processing
that are best suited to modern English, I used an edition of <em>The
Canterbury Tales</em> that regularizes and modernizes Chaucer’s
spelling: Project Gutenberg’s e-text of D. Laing Purves’s 1870s edition,
made “for popular perusal” (Chaucer 2000). It is neither a complete
translation, which would change the etymologies of many words, nor even
a complete spelling modernization. As Purves describes it, “where the
old spelling or form seemed essential to metre, to rhyme, or meaning, no
change has been attempted. But, wherever its preservation was not
essential, the spelling of the monkish transcribers—for the most ardent
purist must now despair of getting at the spelling of Chaucer
himself—has been discarded for that of the reader’s own day.” I manually
divided this text into prologues, tales, and epilogues, and then parsed
the lines programmatically, removing glosses, footnotes, and other
artifacts.</p>
<h2 id="the-algorithm">The Algorithm</h2>
<p>The tool used for this analysis, macro-etym, is a Python script I had
written for an earlier analysis, but one which I expanded and customized
greatly for this project. It uses an opinionated algorithm for
determining the etymology of a word, and one that deserves a brief
description. It begins by tokenizing a text using <a
href="http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html#module-nltk.tokenize.treebank">Penn
Treebank conventions</a>, then removes stopwords (common functional
words like “a” and “the” that don’t contribute much to the analysis),
infers their parts of speech, and lemmatizes the tagged results,
regularizing plurals to their singular forms, and verbs to their bare
infinitives. Then, it searches for the word in the <a
href="http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~demelo/etymwn/">Etymological
Wordnet</a>, a database created from parsing Wiktionary etymological
data (Melo 2014).</p>
<p>If the word is found, but its ancestors are determined to belong to
the same language as the original (for instance, modern English words
composed by conjoining two other English words), or if the ancestor
belongs to a “middle” language variant, like Middle English, macro-etym
searches for another ancestor. For all other words, the first ancestor
is used. This logic is intended to foreground meaningful etymological
resonances. This means that the few Old English words that are actually
of Latin derivation, are labeled as Old English, but this might be
considered a feature, since these words tend to be indistinguishable
from Germanic words to the modern ear. In addition to ignoring current
languages, macro-etym also ignores affixes by default. Rather than parse
a word like “automobile” as, say, 40% Greek (-<em>auto</em>) and 60%
Latin (-<em>mobile</em>), it just considers these prefixes, like
stopwords, to be background functions of the language, and incidental to
the etymological resonance of the word, which in this case would be
labeled as Latin.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>If a given word is not found in the Etymological Wordnet, macro-etym
will attempt a custom lemmatization of the word according to
morphological patterns of Middle English. If the lemma is still not
found, it will search for the word in a secondary etymological wordnet
of 19,135 words of Middle English, which I created from parsing all the
word forms listed in the Project Gutenberg edition of A.L. Mayhew and
Walter Skeat’s 1888 <em>A Concise Dictionary of Middle English</em>. If
not found there, it will finally search for the word in an experimental
tertiary wordnet of 38,074 words, awkwardly assembled by parsing the
irregular etymological strings from a plain-text edition of the Oxford
English Dictionary.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Once a word is found in one of the three wordnets, it is then
categorized according to language family, the biggest categories being
Germanic, containing words of Old English, German, Dutch, and
Scandinavian origin; Latinate, containing words of Latin, French,
Italian, and Spanish origin; Hellenic, containing mostly words of
Ancient Greek origin; and Semitic, containing words of Hebrew
origin.</p>

<p>Figure 1 shows the proportions of Latinate, Germanic, Hellenic, and
Semitic language families, organized by tale. Immediately noticeable
here is that the scales are quite different: proportions of Germanic
words fluctuate between 50 and 75 percent (these numbers are higher
without stopwords removed); proportions of Latinate words fall between
20 and 50 percent, and Hellenic and Semitic words all represent less
than three percent of the total. Since some of these texts are very
short—Chaucer’s final “retraction,” for instance, is only 369 words—we
should treat the final two language families with some degree of
suspicion, since in those cases, the fluctuations here reflect only the
difference of about eleven words. It is for this reason that I will be
focusing primarily on Latinate words here.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 2: Latinate Words, All Prologues
and Tales</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure 2 shows the proportions of Latinate words per tale, subdivided
into individual languages. Broadly speaking, the prologues and tales
with the highest proportions of Latinate words are the prose tales: the
Chaucer character’s Tale of Melibee at 51.6%, and the Parson’s Tale, at
50.33%. Chaucer’s final retraction, also in prose, is at 41.0%, and the
next highest proportions are in Franklin’s prologue, at 40.4%, the Nun’s
Priest’s Tale at 38.7%, and the Clerk’s, at 38.5%. Yet this
macro-etymological analysis is not just detecting a prose signal, as
opposed to one of metered poetry, as will later become more apparent.
There might be a few reasons why Latinate words appear more often in
prose. First, the metrical requirements of Chaucer’s line might not as
easily allow many contiguous multisyllabic words, as are typical of many
Latinate words; they are allowed in prose. Next, the prose modes of The
Canterbury Tales are all dramatic departures from their environs,
dramatic in both in intensity and theatricality, so it is fitting that
their etymological modes are also contrasting.</p>
<p>Conversely, the tales with the lowest proportions of Latinate words
are all prologues, and with the exception of the Summoner’s, all from
Fragment I: the Reeve’s at 19.9%, the Cook’s at 21.7%, the Summoner’s at
21.9%, and the Miller’s, at 22.3%. Unlike other prologues in the
<em>Canterbury Tales</em>, these feature a high incidence of dialogue,
which might be expected to have fewer Latinate words than the more
constructed modes of many of the tales.</p>
<p>One important facet of this Latinate proportions analysis is its
jagged, sawtooth shape across contiguous tales in a given fragment. The
first of these patterns appears between the Knight’s tale and the
Miller’s prologue: there is a sharp drop in proportions of Latinate
words, indicating a sharp difference in tonality. The inflated tone of
the Knight’s tale, which ends with a happy wedding, or rather, the Latin
<em>matrimoigne</em> and French <em>mariage</em> (I.3095), is quickly
deflated by the Miller, who “for dronken was al pale,” and who swears,
using words that would be at home in (a Middle English translation of)
<em>Beowulf</em>, “By armes, and by blood and bones, / I kan a noble
tale for the nones, / With which I wol now quite the Knyghtes tale”
(I.3125-7). The Miller’s tale itself, as most tales do, shows a higher
proportion of Latinate words than its prologue, but this elevation is
temporary, for the quiting dynamic that the Miller inaugurates is
continued with even greater force by the Reeve, whose prologue shows the
lowest proportion of Latinate words in the fragment. The etymological
trend within these fragments is one of Latinate oratorial floridity
answered by raw, punchy Germanic talk.</p>
<p>Another notable quiting exchange, and one which is also observable
along this etymological axis, is that between the Friar and the
Summoner. There, the quiting dynamic reaches its apotheosis: the Friar’s
tale explicitly concerns a corrupt Summoner, who is literally a devil in
disguise. And lest we believe, after this, that the satirical depictions
of fellow pilgrims couldn’t get any more profane, the Summoner’s
Prologue answers this with a scene where “out of the develes ers ther
gonne dryve / Twenty thousand freres” (III.1694-5). This contrasts
greatly with the Latinate moral lesson with which the Summoner ends his
tale, and this contrast is clearly shown in the macro-etymological
analysis.</p>
<p>A third pair, and one that exhibits one of the most dramatic shifts
in etymological tone, is that between the Clerk’s tale and the
Merchant’s prologue. The Clerk, who has been forewarned by the Host to
“Speketh so plain at this time, … / That we may understonde what ye
seye” (IV.19-20), nonetheless embarks on a verbose tale, full of verbal
flourishes. The tale is set in Italy, and represents a relatively
faithful translation from the Petrarchan story <em>De obedienta ac fide
uxoria mythologie</em>, a fact which may help to explain the high
incidence of Latinate words (Chaucer 2008, 880). It ends with what is
announced, in French, to be “Lenvoy de Chaucer,” and a flurry of words
of French origin: <em>reverence, eloquence, aventaille</em>, and
<em>apparaille</em>, to choose a few. This high French mode is brought
crashing down into the Anglo-Saxon world of bones and ale with the
“murye” words of the Host, who exclaims, “By Goddes bones, Me were
levere than a barel ale / My wyf at hoom had herd this legende ones!”
(IV.1213-5). The Merchant echoes the Host’s sentiments of marital woe in
his short Prologue that follows, one which is light on invocation, but
thick with casual Germanic dialogue.</p>
<p>When each tale is broken into eight equal segments, and each segment
is etymologically analyzed, the multi-line segment with the lowest
proportion of Latinate words is from the Reeve’s Prologue. Here, the
Reeve tells the Miller that while he may appear old, he is not weak. It
shows the quiting theme hard at work, and is thus highly
Anglo-Saxon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if I fare as dooth an open-ers—<br />
That ilke fruyt is ever lenger the wers,<br />
Til it be roten in mullok or in stree.<br />
We olde men, I drede, so fare we:<br />
Til we be roten, kan we nat be rype;<br />
We hoppen alway whil that the world wol pype.<br />
For in oure wyl ther stiketh ever a nayl,<br />
To have a hoor heed and a grene tayl,<br />
As hath a leek; … (I.3871-3879)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Reeve, in comparing himself to the medlar, uses a colorful
colloquial term for the fruit, “open-erse.” This is a term of decidedly
Germanic origin—it is <em>arse,</em> and not the French-derived
<em>derrière</em> or the Latin-derived <em>posterior</em>. The rest of
the passage is literally a <em>pot pourri</em> of Germanic words, mostly
from Old English. The rhetorical effect of this string of staccato
Germanic is one that answers the vulgar French with which the Miller
ends his tale—“Thurgh fantasie that of his vanytee”; “<em>par
compaignye</em>” (I.3835, -9)—with a set of food analogies that is, like
the rotten fruit itself, down to earth.</p>
<p>In contrast, the multi-line segment with the highest proportion of
Latinate words is from Chaucer’s retraction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wherefore I biseke yow mekely, for the mercy of God, that ye preye
for me that Crist have mercy on me and foryeve me my giltes; / and
namely of my translacions and enditynges of worldly vanitees, the whiche
I revoke in my retracciouns: (X.1083-4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However much this prose passage may be an ironic advertisement for
Chaucer’s other works, a list of which will soon follow, it nonetheless
evokes a mood of sacerdotal sincerity and rhetorical flourish, achieved
in part by its Latinate vocabulary. There is a legal resonance in
<em>enditynges, revoke</em> and <em>retracciouns,</em> for instance,
which all enter English from Latin, by way of Old French.</p>
<p>When each tale is analyzed according to stanza, however, a different
picture emerges. According to this analysis, the multi-line stanza with
the lowest Latinate proportion is from the Man of Law’s tale, a
description of Constance’s journey:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Forth gooth hir ship thrughout the narwe mouth<br />
Of Jubaltare and Septe, dryvynge ay<br />
Sometyme west, and sometyme north and south,<br />
And sometyme est, ful many a wery day,<br />
Til Christes mooder—blessed be she ay!—<br />
Hath shapen, thurgh hir endelees goodnesse,<br />
To amek an ende of al hir hevynesse. (II.946-52)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, the Germanic words <em>ship</em>, <em>mouth</em>,
<em>driving</em>, <em>north</em>, <em>south</em>, <em>east</em>, and
<em>west</em> are situated in the anaphoraic sequence
“sometime…sometime” that evokes an epic mood, aggrandizing Constance’s
journey, and performing its “many a wery day” in what one might call a
wearysome way. The monosyllabic nature of many of these words allows for
the Man of Law’s hyponotic meter to further enhance this effect. The
Germanic words <em>blessed</em>, <em>endelees</em>, <em>goodnesse</em>,
and <em>heavynesse</em> have a simple quality appropriate to an innocent
and much-maligned saint character as Constance, one that constrasts
sharply with the description of the Roman Senator’s analogous journey
that follows, where the Senator very Latinously “repaireth with victorie
/ To Romeward, … saillynge ful roially” (967-8).</p>
<p>Another such royal description appears in the multi-line stanza with
the highest proportion of Latinate words, the ekphrastic description of
Nebuchadnezzar, from the Monk’s tale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The myghty trone, the precious tresor,<br />
The glorious ceptre, and roial magestee<br />
That hadde the kyng Nebugodonosor<br />
With tonge unnethe may discryved bee.<br />
The twyes wan Jerusalem the citee;<br />
The vessel of the temple he with hym ladde.<br />
At Babiloigne was his sovereyn see,<br />
In which his glorie and his delit he hadde. (VII.2143-50)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with Constance and the Roman senator, there are contrasting
Germanic and Latinate modes that coincide with innocence and experience,
Christianity and classicism. Compare the passage above with the Monk’s
Germanic description of prelapsarian Adam as “With Goddes owene fynger
wroght ws he, And nat bigeten of mannes sperme unclene” (VII 2008-9). As
mentioned earlier, there is a certain gravitas to the French word
<em>royal</em> that is not as pronounced as in an equivalent word of Old
English descent, such as <em>kingly</em>, just as the word
<em>gravitas</em> itself sounds more serious than Constance’s
<em>hevynesse</em>. Chaucer doesn’t use these modes unironically,
however, for the Monk’s historical histrionics is soon negated almost
bathotically by the Knight, who, though guilty of excessive verbosity
himself, pleads to have “namoore of this,” the Monk’s cast of characters
(VIII.3957).</p>

<p>So far we have discussed the macro-etymologies of tales and
prologues, but what might we discover about the macro-etymologies of the
various parts of individual tales? To answer to this question, I divided
each prologue and tale into eight equally-sized parts, and ran
macro-etym across each of them. Somewhat surprisingly, a fairly
consistent trend may be seen across the narrative time of each tale, no
matter the tale. Figure 3 shows the percentages of Latinate words per
segment, averaged across all tales and prologues. On average, the first
eighth of each tale shows roughly six percent more Latinate words than
the last eighth, with intermediary tales showing a gradual falling
gradient. There may be a number of possible explanations for this
phenomenon, but my theory is that Latinate words are most likely to
appear in descriptions: descriptions of characters, scenes, and ideas,
which are most likely to fall at the beginning of a tale. Prayers and
invocations, as well, which are high in Latinate words, happen more
often, and for longer stretches of time, at the beginnings of tales.
Other narrative elements, like dialogue, are statistically much lower in
Latinate words, and are more likely to fall in the middle or end of a
tale.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>While this study is by no means novel, and has been preceded by
centuries of analogous macro-etymological analysis, the narrative
explanation of these trends, one that situates them among the pilgrims’
interpersonal dynamics—departs from prior philological methods that have
explained these trends in terms of Chaucer’s sources, personal
vocabulary, or educational history. To summarize, I have found that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sudden shifts in etymological register, along the Latinate axis, at
least, are coincident with the sudden shifts in tone that accompany the
“quiting” interchanges among pilgrims.</li>
<li>Prose tales show much higher proportions of Latinate words than
verse tales.</li>
<li>In general, tales exhibit roughly 50% more Latinate words than
prologues.</li>
<li>When divided into segments, the average trend across tales is a drop
in the use of Latinate words. This is more pronounced in tales than in
prologues.</li>
